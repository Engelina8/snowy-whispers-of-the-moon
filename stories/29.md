As you rise, something unexpected happens. The sky, caught between night and day, erupts in color.

The sky blooms in ribbons of light — silent music for the soul.

Green and violet and gold stream across the horizon, an aurora born from the collision of your departure and her grief. The colors dance and twist, painting the dawn with something neither of you could create alone.

You pause mid-rise, transfixed. "What is this?" you call down.

Angie looks up, and her face is illuminated by the shifting colors. "It's us," she calls back. "When the sun and moon touch, even for a moment, this is what happens. Beauty born from impossible connection."

The aurora pulses and swirls, and you realize it's not random. It's a message, a promise written in light and color: I was here. You were here. We were real.

"It's beautiful," you say, voice catching.

Angie laughs, the sound bright and broken. "It's hope," she says. "That's what the aurora always is — hope born from darkness, color born from the cold."

You watch the ribbons dance, and a memory surfaces: the first time you saw this phenomenon, centuries ago, after the first solstice meeting. You and Angie had stood together, watching the sky celebrate your brief union, and you'd promised each other that as long as the aurora could bloom, your friendship would endure.

"I remember," you say, wonder flooding your voice. "I remember this promise."

Angie's smile is radiant. "Then take it with you," she says. "When the world gets dark and you forget why you keep falling, look for the aurora. It will remind you."

The colors intensify, a silent symphony of light. You feel the pull of the sun growing stronger, the need to rise becoming undeniable.

"I'll look for it," you promise. "Every solstice. I'll watch for the colors and know you're there."

The aurora flares one last time, brilliant and fierce, then begins to fade as the sun claims the sky. But the promise remains, etched in the memory of light and color.

You rise higher, the obsidian sphere warm against your chest, the golden thread binding you to her even as distance grows. The aurora's music plays on in silence, a song only the two of you can hear.
