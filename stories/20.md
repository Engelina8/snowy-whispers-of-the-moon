Angie pulls a large white scarf from the chest, unfolding it with reverence. The fabric is impossibly soft, long enough to wrap around both of you twice over.

"This is for when the world gets too loud," she says, draping it over your shoulders. "When you need a moment to breathe."

She pulls one end around herself, and suddenly you're enclosed together in a pocket of warmth and quiet. The cave outside seems to fade, the sounds muffled and distant.

You close your eyes and let the stillness settle over you. A memory surfaces: you, overwhelmed by the weight of a thousand prayers, the constant pull of expectation. Angie wrapping this same scarf around you, creating a sanctuary where no one could reach. Where you could just be.

"I forgot how much I needed this," you murmur.

Angie's voice is soft beside you. "You always carried too much," she says. "Everyone wanted a piece of you, and you gave and gave until there was nothing left. This scarf was the only place where you were allowed to say no."

You lean into the warmth, into her presence. The scarf creates a boundary — not to shut the world out, but to protect the small, fragile parts of you that can't withstand constant exposure.

"The ritual is going to be hard," Angie says after a moment. "It's going to ask you to remember everything — the glory, the fall, the punishment, the choice. And it's going to ask you to let go."

You open your eyes and look at her. "Let go of what?"

Her expression is gentle but firm. "Of the idea that you have to carry it all alone," she says. "Of the belief that love means sacrifice without rest. Of the fear that being small makes you worthless."

You swallow hard. "That's a lot to let go of."

She nods. "I know. But you don't have to do it all at once. The scarf is here. I'm here. When it gets too loud, we'll wrap ourselves in this, and we'll breathe together."

You pull the scarf tighter, feeling the soft fabric against your skin. It's not a solution. It's not a cure. But it's a refuge, and right now, that's enough.

"Thank you," you say quietly.

Angie smiles, her eyes warm. "Always," she says. "For as long as the night allows."

The ritual waits just beyond the scarf's edge. But here, in the quiet, you gather your strength. You remember who you are beneath the glory. And you prepare to face what comes next — not alone, but held.
