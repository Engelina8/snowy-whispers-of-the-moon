Angie leads you to the mouth of the cave, where the sky opens wide and endless. She points upward, and you follow her gaze to the constellations scattered across the dark.

"Do you see that one?" she asks, tracing a pattern with her finger. "The crooked line with the three bright stars at the end?"

You squint, then nod. "I see it."

"That's ours," she says quietly. "We made it. The first time we met, we rearranged a handful of stars just to leave a mark. To prove we'd been together."

The stars draw their own letters across the sky — and the message feels meant for you.

A memory rushes in: the two of you laughing, giddy with rebellion, nudging stars into new positions like children rearranging furniture. It was a small act of defiance, a way of saying we were here, and it mattered.

"They never noticed," you say, the memory sharp and bright.

Angie grins. "No. They were too busy watching the big things — the eclipses, the solstices, the tides. They never looked for the small rebellions."

You stare at the constellation, feeling a swell of pride and grief. "It's still there," you whisper. "After everything, it's still there."

She nods, her expression soft. "Some things last," she says. "Even when we don't."

You reach out and take her hand, and together you stand beneath the crooked constellation — your constellation. The stars blink down at you, patient and knowing.

"What does it mean?" you ask. "The pattern. Did we give it a name?"

Angie's smile is bittersweet. "We called it 'The Thread,'" she says. "Because it was the thing that tied us together when everything else tried to pull us apart."

You stare at the stars, and the message is clear: you existed. You loved. You defied the rules and left proof behind.

"I want to remember this," you say fiercely. "When I go back. I want to remember that we made something that lasted."

Angie squeezes your hand. "You will," she promises. "Even if the details fade, you'll remember the feeling. The Thread will hold."

The night is thinning faster now. The ritual is close. But here, beneath the constellation you built together, you feel anchored — not to the sky or the earth, but to her. To the choice you made and the love that refused to be erased.

The stars hum their agreement. The Thread holds.
