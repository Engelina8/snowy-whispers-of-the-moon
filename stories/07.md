A low bell threads the air across the plain, soft and slow, and a pale herd slides past like a small constellation laid on the snow. Their breath fogs in the space between you and the horizon; the sound of hooves is a patient, steady chorus that makes the ribs of the world seem to settle.

She watches them with a little laugh, eyes bright. "They always slow when we pass," she says, as if this is the oldest of jokes. "They remember the route better than anyone." She reaches for your hand, thumb finding the familiar line at your wrist, and for a trembling moment the cold eases.

One of the reindeer lifts its head close enough that you can see the pale pattern along its flank, and a memory like a moth flutters at the edge of your mind: you and her, counting antlers under a sky so wide you could get lost inside it, a childish game that ended with laughter that tasted like copper and snow. The image is quick, a blink of light that almost makes sense.

"Hold on to that," she murmurs, pressing the warmth of her palm to your knuckles. "Keep it here for me. If you forget everything else, keep this."

The glimpse wavers as the herd moves on, the sound thinning into the wind. She tugs you gently forward, patient and determined. "Come on, we need to go on. We can't linger too long." The road ahead feels both known and strange, and the thought of leaving with that small, bright memory in your chest leaves an odd kind of ache behind.
