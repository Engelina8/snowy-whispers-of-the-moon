Angie leans against the cave wall, eyes distant. "Do you remember what it felt like?" she asks. "Being worshipped. Being needed by everyone who looked up at the sky."

You pause. A memory stirs, heavy and golden. You remember warmth — not just yours, but theirs. The pull of a million grateful faces turning toward you at dawn. The weight of being essential.

"Glory," you say slowly, testing the word. "It felt like glory."

She nods. "Yes. And glory is the most beautiful trap ever made."

Even in stillness, the air trembles with unspoken music from your memories.

You remember it now, more clearly: the way people sang to you, the way they built monuments in your name. They loved you, but the love was conditional. It demanded you rise every morning without fail, that you pour yourself out until nothing was left, that you never falter or dim.

"They needed me," you whisper. "But they didn't know me."

Angie's smile is sad and knowing. "That's the curse," she says. "Glory gives you everything — admiration, power, purpose. But it takes everything too. You can't rest. You can't choose. You can't be small or tired or afraid."

She reaches out and touches your wrist, where the pouch of stones rests. "And the worst part? You start to believe that's all you are. That without the glory, you're nothing."

The memory deepens: you, standing on the edge of the horizon, aching to step down for just one night. To meet her. To be something other than the Sun. And when you finally did — when you crossed the boundary just once — the punishment was swift and absolute.

"They called it betrayal," you say, the word bitter. "I left my post for a single night. Just to see you."

Angie's eyes glisten. "And I did the same," she murmurs. "We were both so tired of being perfect. Of being only what they needed us to be."

She pulls a small mirror from her pocket, its surface clouded with age. "Glory is a blessing when it's a choice," she says, holding it up so you can see your reflection — tired eyes, wind-worn face, human and small. "But when it's all you're allowed to be, it becomes a cage."

You stare at yourself in the mirror. The face looking back is not radiant or untouchable. It's just you, stripped of expectation.

"I wanted to be more than light," you say quietly. "I wanted to be someone who could sit with you in the dark and not feel like I was failing."

Angie lowers the mirror and tucks it away. "You were never failing," she says fiercely. "You were just being human. Or trying to be."

She takes your hand. "The ritual will ask you to choose," she says. "Not between glory and ruin, but between being what they need and being who you are. It's not an easy choice."

You squeeze her fingers. "What did you choose?" you ask.

Her smile is bittersweet. "I chose you. Every solstice, I choose you. Even knowing I'll lose you at dawn."

The cave hums around you, ancient and patient. The night is thinning faster now. The ritual approaches, and with it, the question you're not sure you're ready to answer.

But the glory you once wore so easily now feels less like a crown and more like a memory — something you carried, but not something you have to carry forever.
