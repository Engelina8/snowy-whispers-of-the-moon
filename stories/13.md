The snow begins to fall harder, a curtain drawn between you and the world. Angie pauses, then pulls a white umbrella from her bag with the careful reverence of someone unwrapping a sacred thing.

She opens it with a soft snap. The fabric is plain and pale, unmarked by time or weather. She holds it over both of you, and the storm slides away as if embarrassed by its own noise.

"Here," she says, adjusting the handle so you can hold it too. Your fingers brush hers. The touch is brief and warm, a small anchor in the cold.

Moonbeams stretch across the distance, tender and eternal.

Beneath the umbrella, the world shrinks to something manageable. The cave waits ahead, but here, for a breath, there is only the two of you and the quiet hush of sheltered space.

A memory unfolds like a letter left too long in a drawer: the two of you huddled under something similar, laughing at a storm that tried too hard to be frightening. You remember the shape of her shoulder against yours, the way safety felt like a shared secret.

"You always liked this," Angie says softly. "The small refuge. The idea that we could block out the rest of the world when we needed to." Her voice carries a weight you're beginning to recognize — the ache of remembering when the other person can't.

You hold the umbrella steady. The fabric is cool but reassuring, a boundary between the chaos outside and the warmth you're starting to reclaim.

She touches the edge of the umbrella, tracing a seam. "We'll need this later," she murmurs. "When the ritual gets loud. When the world tries to pull us apart again." Her eyes meet yours, and for a moment the fear is visible — not of the storm, but of the goodbye that waits at dawn.

"Come on," she says, gentler now. "The cave is close. We can rest inside for a while before we start."

You fold your hand over hers on the handle, just for a second. The umbrella holds. The snow falls around you but does not touch. The path ahead glows faintly, patient and inevitable.
