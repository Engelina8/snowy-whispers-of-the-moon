As the girl passes by the frozen stream, tiny ripples hum their secret songs, untouched by frost. They seem to perk up as she passes, as if she has a pull on them, like the moon controls the tides. A waft of smoke passes before them, carrying with it a calming scent reminiscent of a white flower. "It's Neroli", the woman says, smiling softly. "You said you liked it last time. That the flower reminded you of me. I gave you a bundle of them to take with you last time."
