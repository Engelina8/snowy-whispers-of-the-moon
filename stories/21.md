Angie leads you deeper into the cave, where the walls open into a small grotto. In the center, a single flower grows from the stone itself — petals white as bone, glowing faintly in the dark.

"A moonflower," she says softly. "It only blooms during our meetings. When the sun falls and the moon is allowed to be close."

You kneel beside it, mesmerized. The petals unfold slowly, deliberately, as if each movement costs something precious.

For a moment, time holds its breath — and every flake becomes a frozen heartbeat.

A memory blooms with the flower: you, watching this same blossom open for the first time. Angie beside you, her hand in yours, whispering that some things only grow in the dark. That beauty doesn't need daylight to be real.

"It grows when the sun fades," you murmur, understanding settling deep.

Angie nods. "Yes. It needs the absence of light to thrive. Just like us."

You reach out carefully and touch one of the petals. It's impossibly soft, warm despite the cold. The flower hums under your fingertips, a gentle vibration that travels up your arm and settles in your chest.

"We're not broken," Angie says quietly, watching you. "We were just made for a different kind of existence. One that blooms in the spaces between."

You look up at her, and the truth of it lands clean and sure. You were never meant to shine all the time. You were meant to rest, to fade, to let the dark hold you so something fragile and beautiful could grow.

"The ritual will ask you to accept that," she continues. "To stop fighting the fall. To let yourself bloom in the night instead of burning through it."

You press your palm flat against the stone beside the flower. "And if I do?" you ask. "If I accept it?"

Her smile is bittersweet. "Then maybe the punishment becomes something else," she says. "Maybe it becomes a choice. A different way of being."

The moonflower glows brighter for a breath, then settles back into its steady luminescence. You stand, feeling the weight of the decision ahead.

"I'm ready," you say, and mean it.

Angie takes your hand. "Then let's begin."
