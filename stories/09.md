A silver stick glints between her fingers, the shaft cold and true. At its tip a small blue gem waits like a captured piece of sky — clear, honest, the colour of early dawn.

"Hold still," she says. Short and simple. You do.

She tucks the stick through a loose strand of your hair with the carefulness of someone mending a torn map. The metal slides like a quiet thought; the blue gem catches a thread of starlight and throws it across your cheek.

For a breath you remember the sound of someone laughing as they tried to braid your hair badly. A hand, clumsy and warm, tying knots then apologising with tea. The image is small and stubborn; it will not be pushed away.

She hums as she works, a tune without words that fits the shape of quiet rooms. "There," she says when it's done, fingers lingering. "A small thing to keep you together when the world wants to pull you apart."

You reach up, feeling the cool metal and the stone against your skin. The gem seems to sharpen the edges of thought for a flaring second — a word almost there, a name half-turned.A single flame dances in defiance of the cold, small but certain. It retreats, but it leaves a sliver of light.

She smiles, and the smile is an old map folded into a pocket. The road ahead hums.
