The cave is quiet now, the only sound the soft crackle of a lantern. Angie sits across from you, her face half-lit, half-shadow. She hasn't spoken in a while, but you can feel her thinking — the weight of words forming and dissolving before they reach the air.

"There are things I want to tell you," she says finally, voice low. "But I don't know if saying them out loud will make them real or if it will break them."

You watch her carefully. "Then don't say them," you offer. "Not yet."

She smiles, small and grateful. "You always understood that," she murmurs. "That some things live better in the space between us. In the knowing without naming."

Some truths are whispered only between hearts.

A memory surfaces: the two of you sitting in a place that existed outside of time, speaking without words. You knew what she needed before she asked. She knew what you feared before you confessed it. The language you shared wasn't made of sound but of presence — the way her breath changed when she was sad, the way your light dimmed when you were tired.

"I remember," you say quietly. "We didn't always need words."

Angie's eyes brighten. "No," she agrees. "We had something better. We had thought. The kind that travels without distance, that arrives whole and unbroken."

She leans forward, resting her elbows on her knees. "That's what they couldn't understand," she says. "Why we risked everything just to sit together. They thought we were reckless. But we weren't trying to speak or touch or prove anything. We just wanted to exist in the same moment."

You nod, the understanding settling deep. "It wasn't about the meeting," you say. "It was about not being alone in our own heads."

"Exactly," she whispers, and the relief in her voice is palpable. "You were the only one who ever heard me without me having to shout."

She reaches across the space between you, palm up. You place your hand in hers, and the connection is immediate — not touch, but recognition. The thought passes between you effortlessly: I'm here. I remember. I still hear you.

"When the ritual starts," Angie says, "they'll ask you to speak your intention. But you don't have to use words if you don't want to. They'll hear you either way."

You squeeze her hand gently. "Will you hear me?" you ask.

Her smile is soft and sure. "Always," she says. "I've been hearing you since the first time you thought my name."

The night continues to thin, but here, in the quiet, the truths that matter most remain unspoken and perfectly understood.
