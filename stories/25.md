Angie guides you to the edge of the circle, where the ritual's final marker waits — a small brazier filled with golden thread.

"This is memory," she says. "The thread that weaves endings into beginnings. Every goodbye becomes the seed of the next meeting."

She picks up a strand and ties it around your wrist, beside the pouch of stones. "This is for remembering," she says. "Not the details, but the shape of us. The feeling of being known."

The first light of morning brushes the world with warmth — a promise kept.

You look toward the cave entrance and see it: the faintest glow of dawn creeping across the horizon. Your time is almost up.

"It's happening," you say, panic rising. "I'm going to have to leave."

Angie nods, her expression both sad and steady. "Yes," she says. "The sun must rise. That's the rule we can't break."

You grip the golden thread, desperate. "What if I don't want to go? What if I stay here with you?"

Her smile is heartbreaking. "Then the world stays dark," she says gently. "And everyone who needs you suffers. You know that."

You do know. The weight of it settles heavy: your friendship cannot come at the cost of everyone else's light. The punishment was cruel, but the responsibility is real.

"So I just... go?" you ask, voice breaking.

Angie takes both your hands. "You go," she says. "But you take me with you. In the thread, in the stone, in the constellation. I'm woven into you now, and you into me. Every sunrise will carry a piece of this night."

You pull her close, holding her as tightly as you can. "I'll find you again," you promise. "Next solstice. I'll fall, and I'll find you."

"I know," she whispers against your hair. "I'll be waiting. I'm always waiting."

The golden thread around your wrist glows softly, binding the promise. You step back, memorizing her face — the silver hair, the gentle eyes, the sad smile that holds a thousand partings.

"Angie," you say, testing the name one more time.

"Yes," she says. "That's me. Remember that, if you can."

The dawn light grows stronger, pulling at you like a tide. The obsidian sphere in your hand hums, anchoring you even as the world tries to sweep you away.

"Go," Angie says, though her voice cracks. "The world needs its sun."

You turn toward the light, the thread around your wrist catching fire with gold. The ritual is complete. The return has begun.

And as you step into the dawn, you carry her with you — woven into every ray, every warmth, every shadow you cast at dusk.
