She stops at a bend in the path and gestures with a quiet hand. You look up. Flowers drift in the air above the snow, glowing like small lanterns forgotten by the . Some of them are in bloom, others still closed, yet they all glow regardless. Each one pulses faintly, luminous and slow, as if breathing.

At their bases, black snakes coil in patient spirals, bodies smooth as polished obsidian. They do not hiss. They simply wait, holding the flowers afloat with the weight of old bargains.

"Beautiful, aren't they?" Angie says, voice careful. "They bloom where promises were broken and remade. The snakes keep them honest."

The path glows faintly under the moon's touch, leading deeper into the hush of snow.

You reach toward one of the flowers but stop before your fingers meet its light. A memory surfaces like a stone through shallow water: kneeling in a garden that no longer exists, making an offering that cost more than you thought it would. The image is brief and bitter.

"Yes," Angie murmurs, watching your hand. "You remember the price, don't you? Beauty always asks for something." She touches one of the snakes gently; it shifts but does not strike. "We had to give up walking in daylight together. That was the first trade."

You lower your hand. The flowers continue their slow drift, indifferent to grief. The snakes remain coiled, patient as old scars.

She pulls a small vial from her pocket and tips three drops of oil onto the snow. The liquid sinks in and the nearest flower brightens for a heartbeat. "Another offering," she says. "We'll need more before we reach the cave. The ritual demands precision."

You help her arrange the remaining vials in a careful line. Each one is labeled with a symbol you half-recognize. The work is delicate. The snakes watch with unblinking eyes.

"Not much further now," Angie says, tucking the last vial away. "The cave knows we're coming. It's been waiting all night."
