Frost writes in a hand that no one keeps. It traces little letters on the glass and the water replies with soft silver. The words are delicate and disappear when the light leans wrong.

She leans close to the ice and draws a crooked line with her finger, scattering the snow that has gathered atop the frozen water. "See?" she says, voice small and pleased. "It remembers us in the corners where people never look."

You watch the pattern for a long breath. The shapes are like fragments of a sentence you almost know. A shard of meaning, a curl of a letter. It does not give you a full phrase. It gives you warmth — the feeling of having written something and then folding it into a pocket.

She sets a lantern on the snowbank and its light splinters across the frost-letters. "We used to leave messages for each other like this," she says, smiling in a way that turns the world sideways. "Tiny things to find later, so you would know I had been there."

You reach out and let your fingertip smudge one of the letters. The trace left on your skin tastes of iron, faint and honest. For a breath you remember the feel of a nib across paper, the impatient scratch of someone writing your name for a joke. The memory is small. It will not hold a long story.

She watches you do it. "Keep that one," she murmurs. "Keep the small things until you can hold bigger ones." Her hand finds yours when she says it and squeezes. "We have to get to the cave. We have to start preparing, wouldn't want to get punished again."
