Angie reaches up and unpins something from her hair. A black claw clip with delicate blue flowers painted along its edge. She holds it in her palm for a moment, then offers it to you.

"Here," she says. "Trade with me."

You blink, confused. "Trade?"

She laughs softly. "You have one too. Look."

You reach up instinctively and feel the clip in your own hair — golden, with tiny pink flowers. You don't remember putting it in, but it's there, familiar and sure.

In every pause, in every sigh, something wordless reaches across the night.

You pull the golden clip free and hold it out. She takes it with a smile that's both playful and reverent, tucking it into her own hair with practiced ease. You do the same with hers, the black clip cold against your fingers before it settles into place.

"There," she says, stepping back to look at you. "Now we're carrying each other."

A memory blooms: the two of you doing this same ritual lifetimes ago. Swapping small objects, tokens of trust. A way of saying I see you. I hold you. I carry you with me even when we're apart.

"We used to do this all the time," you say, the realization warm and bittersweet.

Angie nods. "Every meeting. We'd trade something small — a clip, a ribbon, a stone. So that even when you went back to the sky and I stayed in the night, we'd have proof that the other existed."

You touch the black clip in your hair, feeling the painted flowers beneath your fingertips. "It's like a piece of you," you murmur.

She touches the golden one in hers. "And a piece of you," she echoes. "We're woven together, even when they try to keep us apart."

The gesture is small, but the meaning is enormous. You're not just the Sun and the Moon anymore. You're two people who chose to be tangled, who chose to carry each other's burdens and joys across impossible distances.

"I'll keep it safe," you promise.

Her smile is soft and sure. "I know," she says. "You always do."

The cave hums with quiet magic. The night thins. The ritual waits. But here, with her clip in your hair and yours in hers, you feel less alone than you have in millennia.
