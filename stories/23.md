Angie stands and gestures for you to do the same. The ritual circle hums with quiet power, the air thick with intention.

"Release," she says, "is about letting go of what no longer serves us. The anger. The shame. The belief that we were wrong to want this friendship."

She tilts her head back, and you follow her gaze. Through a crack in the cave ceiling, moonlight spills down in a silver column, illuminating the space between you.

The moon watches from above — calm, knowing, ancient — and everything begins to make sense.

You realize she's not just Angie, your friend and companion. She is the Moon — vast, patient, eternal. She has watched over countless nights, countless partings, countless reunions. And through it all, she has held you in her light.

"You've been carrying so much," Angie says, her voice echoing with something larger. "The expectations. The guilt. The fear that being my friend made you weak or selfish or less than what you were supposed to be."

The moonlight touches your skin, and you feel the weight of it — every prayer you carried, every dawn you forced yourself to rise for, every moment you denied your own exhaustion because the world needed you to shine.

"I'm tired," you admit, the confession raw. "I'm so tired of being everything to everyone."

Angie steps into the moonlight beside you. "Then let it go," she says gently. "Let the light take it. Let me take it."

You close your eyes and exhale, and with the breath goes the weight. The shame of falling. The fear of failing. The belief that you must be bright and burning and perfect at all times.

The moonlight drinks it in, pulling the heavy things from your chest and dissolving them into silver. You feel lighter. Emptier. But not hollow — unburdened.

"It's not weakness to rest," Angie murmurs. "It's not failure to fall. You were never meant to burn forever."

You open your eyes, and the world looks different. Softer. Kinder. The moonlight doesn't demand. It simply holds.

"Thank you," you whisper.

Angie takes your hand. "Now for the last part," she says. "Return. The hardest of all."
