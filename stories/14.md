Inside the cave, the air is warmer than it should be. The walls glow faintly with a light that seems to come from nowhere and everywhere at once. Angie sets the umbrella down and pulls two stones from her pocket, holding them up to the dim light.

One is pale blue, threaded with white — blue lace agate. The other is deeper, translucent and fierce — blue fluorite. She turns them in her fingers like prayer beads.

"These are for us," she says quietly. "Communication. Clarity. So we can speak the things we've been too afraid to say." She places them in your palm, and they're cool and smooth, like words waiting to be spoken.

You close your fingers around the stones. A fog you didn't know was there begins to lift. Thoughts that were tangled and heavy start to unknot themselves, one careful thread at a time.

A memory rises, sharper than before: sitting across from her at a table that no longer exists, trying to explain something that mattered. The words wouldn't come. They stayed locked behind your teeth, stubborn and scared. She reached across and touched your hand, and suddenly the sentence arrived, whole and honest.

"You always helped me find the right words," you say, and the sentence feels like the first true thing you've said in hours.

Angie's eyes brighten. "Yes," she says, and the relief in her voice is palpable. "You're remembering. The stones are working."

You press the blue lace agate to your forehead, and the sensation is like cool water on a burn. A name surfaces — not just hers, but yours. A title you once carried, a role you once played. Sun. You were the sun, and she was the moon, and the two of you were punished for loving the space between day and night.

"We wanted to meet," you whisper, the words fragile and new. "We weren't supposed to. We broke the rules."

Angie nods, her expression soft with old grief. "We thought we could steal a few moments without consequence. We were wrong."

She takes the fluorite and holds it up to the light. "This one is for seeing clearly, even when the truth hurts." The stone catches the glow of the cave and scatters it in tiny prisms across her face, then she hands it back to you. "The ritual tonight will ask us to be honest about what we want. About whether we accept the cost of meeting again."

You hold the stones tighter. The clarity is almost painful, but it's also a gift. You can think now. You can speak.

"Will it work?" you ask. "The ritual. Will it let us stay?"

Angie's smile is small and bittersweet. "No," she says. "But it will let you go home safely. And maybe, if we're careful, it will buy us one more meeting before the cycle turns again."

She tucks the stones into a small pouch and ties it to your wrist. "Keep them close. When the ritual begins, you'll need to remember everything."

The cave's depths wait, patient and ancient. The night is thinning. The work ahead is precise and unforgiving, but for now, the stones hum quietly against your skin, and the words you need are finally within reach.
