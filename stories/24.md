Angie reaches into her cloak and pulls out a dark sphere. Rainbow obsidian, shot through with veins of color that shift and shimmer in the light. She holds it with both hands, reverent and careful.

"This is the truth stone," she says. "It grounds you when the world tries to pull you apart. And it will guide you home when the ritual is complete."

She places it in your hands, and the weight of it is startling — solid, real, undeniable.

You stare into the sphere's depths, and images flicker across its surface: the reindeer, the bracelet, the hair stick, the frost-letters, the tarot card, Angie's name. Every memory you've reclaimed tonight, every piece of yourself you've gathered.

"This is grounding," Angie explains. "It's the anchor that keeps you from losing yourself when you return to the sky. It holds everything you've learned, everything you've remembered."

You turn the sphere in your hands, feeling its cool weight. A memory surfaces: the first time you held this stone, millennia ago, when the punishment was new and the separation felt impossible to bear. Angie had given it to you then, too, a promise that you would find your way back.

"Will it work?" you ask. "Will I remember this time?"

Angie's expression is honest. "I don't know," she admits. "The ritual will help. The stone will help. But the solstice curse is strong. You might lose the details. You might forget my name again."

Your chest tightens. "Then why do we keep doing this?" you ask, voice breaking. "Why do we keep meeting if I'm just going to forget?"

She steps closer, cupping your face with gentle hands. "Because even if you forget the words, you remember the feeling," she says fiercely. "You remember that someone loves you. That someone saw you as more than light and duty. And that memory, even when it's blurred, keeps you human."

You press the obsidian sphere to your chest, feeling its weight settle over your heart. "I don't want to lose you again," you whisper.

"You won't," Angie promises. "Not completely. I'll be here, in the stone, in the stars, in every shadow you see at dusk. And when the winter solstice comes again, I'll be waiting."

You nod, tears slipping down your cheeks. The sphere glows faintly, absorbing your intention, your memory, your love.

"This is the truth," Angie says softly. "You are not alone. You have never been alone. And you will find your way home, because I will always light the path."

The ritual circle hums, ready for the final step. The night is almost over. Dawn is coming.
