A thin chime follows her fingers as she rummages in the bag. She draws out something small wrapped in a scrap of cloth and lets it catch the light. Peach, soft and milky. A moonstone bracelet, each bead like a warm pulse against the cold.

"You said you liked it last time," she says, voice quick with a private memory. "It helps you listen to the shape of things beneath the noise." She slides it over your wrist with careful hands. The stone warms to your skin as if it remembers your blood.

The world tilts. Not with weight, but with knowing. A tiny image surfaces: a narrow bridge, breath clouding the air, and you stepping forward because your gut told you to. The picture is not complete. It does not name the place. It only leaves the feeling — the rightness of the step.

She watches your face as the bracelet hums faintly. You press your palm to the beads. The motion makes the near-forgotten certainty grow by degrees, a small lamp coaxed into flame.

"Keep it close," she murmurs. "When you can't hear yourself, it will help you trust the small pull inside." She touches the bracelet briefly, then tugs lightly at your arm. "Come on. The path won't wait for us."

You let the warmth sit against your pulse, then look up at the sky. Constellations shimmer overhead — a map written in ancient light. It feels like a promise, and promises are heavy in the best way.
