Angie stands and moves to a wooden chest tucked against the cave wall. She opens it with careful hands, as if whatever's inside might break if she's too rough. After a moment, she pulls out something dark and soft.

"I kept this for you," she says, turning. A burgundy cardigan unfolds in her hands, worn at the elbows but still whole. "You lost it the last time. During the fall."

You stare at the cardigan. Recognition hits like a warm tide. "That's mine," you whisper.

She nods, smiling faintly. "Your favorite. You wore it every solstice, said it made you feel less like the Sun and more like yourself."

She holds it out, and you take it with trembling hands. The fabric is soft, familiar. You pull it on, and the fit is perfect — like slipping into your own skin after wearing someone else's for too long.

A memory unfolds: you, sitting on a hillside that no longer exists, wrapped in this exact cardigan. Angie beside you, her hand tucked into yours. The two of you watching the stars shift, speaking in half-sentences and comfortable silences. You remember feeling small in the best way — not diminished, but free.

"I was always afraid to be small," you say quietly. "The Sun isn't supposed to need a cardigan. Isn't supposed to get cold."

Angie's expression softens. "But you did get cold," she says. "And you let me see it. That's what made you real to me."

You pull the cardigan tighter around yourself. The warmth is more than physical. It's the warmth of being known, of being allowed to be fragile.

"I missed this," you admit. "I didn't even remember it until now, but I missed it."

She steps closer, adjusting the collar with gentle fingers. "You left so many things behind when you fell," she murmurs. "Little pieces of yourself scattered across the night. I've been collecting them for you. Keeping them safe."

You meet her eyes, and the gratitude is almost too much to hold. "Thank you," you say, the words small but heavy.

She smiles. "You do the same for me," she says simply.

The cardigan settles around your shoulders like a promise kept. The ritual draws nearer, but for now, you're wrapped in something that remembers who you used to be — and who you still are, beneath the glory and the fall.
