The ritual circle is drawn in the center of the grotto, marked with salt and ash and symbols you're beginning to remember. Angie kneels at one edge, and you mirror her at the other.

"The ritual has three parts," she says, voice steady and ceremonial. "Recognition. Release. Return. We'll start with recognition."

She places a handful of snow in the center of the circle. It doesn't melt. Instead, it hovers, suspended by something older than either of you.

The snow pauses midair, shaping itself into a heart of frost and glow.

You stare at the shape, breath catching. "What is that?" you whisper.

Angie's eyes are soft. "It's what we've always been," she says. "Even when they tried to keep us apart. Even when they called it wrong or reckless or forbidden. This is what we built in the spaces they couldn't see."

The heart pulses gently, light flickering through the ice. It's fragile and fierce, delicate and enduring.

A memory unfolds: the first time you understood what love meant. Not the grand, burning kind. Not the love that demands and consumes. But the quiet kind. The kind that asks for nothing but presence. The kind that says I will hold you, even when the world says I shouldn't. The love that wasn't romantic, in and of itself, but whose steadiness and realness is perhaps the most romantic thing.

"I loved you," you say, the words simple and devastating. "I still do."

Angie's eyes glisten. "I know," she whispers. "I've always known. Even when you forgot, I knew."

The snow-heart spins slowly, casting light across the cave walls. It's not a symbol of romance or possession. It's a symbol of choice — the choice to stay close, even when staying costs everything.

"This is what we're recognizing," Angie says. "Not that we were wrong, but that we were real. That what we built mattered."

You reach toward the heart, and it drifts closer, settling into your palm. The cold is sharp but not painful. It's honest.

"I recognize it," you say, voice firm. "I recognize us."

The heart glows brighter, then dissolves into light that sinks into your skin. The warmth spreads through your chest, settling beside your own heartbeat.

Angie smiles, tears slipping down her cheeks. "Good," she says. "That's the first part. Now we move to release."
