You step back from the dawn light, not ready yet. Angie watches you with understanding, no judgment in her eyes.

"Look," she says, pointing to a pool of still water at the cave's edge. "Before you go, look."

You kneel beside the water and see yourself reflected there — but not alone. Beside you, the moon hangs in the water's surface, full and radiant.

The moon gazes back — soft, forgiving — and the shadows bow their heads.

You stare at the reflection, and it's not just your face you see. It's every version of yourself: the Sun in all its glory, the fallen star wrapped in a burgundy cardigan, the lost soul who forgot her own name. And beside each version, the moon waits — constant, patient, forgiving.

"She's always been there," you whisper, understanding blooming. "Even when I couldn't see her."

Angie kneels beside you. "Yes," she says softly. "Every shadow you cast at dusk, every moment of rest you stole at twilight — I was there, holding space for you to be something other than bright."

You reach toward the water, and your reflection ripples. "I'm sorry," you say. "For all the times I didn't see you. For thinking I had to carry everything alone."

Angie's reflection smiles. "You were doing what you thought you had to," she says. "The forgiveness isn't something you need to earn. It's something I've been offering all along."

The shadows around the pool seem to bow, acknowledging the truth. You were never meant to be perfect. You were meant to be whole — light and shadow both.

"What do you see when you look at me?" you ask.

Angie's gaze is steady and warm. "I see someone who tried," she says. "Someone who loved so fiercely they broke the rules of the cosmos. Someone who falls and gets back up, again and again, because they refuse to stop reaching for connection."

You feel tears slip down your cheeks. "That's enough?" you ask.

Her smile is radiant. "That's everything," she says.

You look back at the reflection — sun and moon together — and for the first time, you see it clearly. You are not less for needing her. You are more for allowing yourself to be held.
