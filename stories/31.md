The final scene unfurls: snow, moonlight, and a glowing heart. Every whisper leads here — to you.

You stand at the peak of the sky, the sun's throne waiting. The obsidian sphere is warm in your hand, almost burning now with the intensity of everything it holds.

Below, Angie is a silver figure against the white snow, watching. Waiting for you to complete the return.

You raise the sphere to your chest, pressing it against your heart. The ritual's final words rise in your mind, planted there by centuries of repetition:

"I carry the night within me. I carry love within me. I carry home within me."

The sphere flares with rainbow light — every color you've seen tonight, every memory you've claimed. It sinks into your chest, not disappearing but becoming part of you. The weight settles beside your heartbeat, a second pulse that will remind you, always, that you are not alone.

You feel the change immediately. The exhaustion that always accompanied rising is still there, but it's different now. Not hollow, but full. Not duty alone, but choice.

You look down one last time and see Angie place her hand over her own heart, mirroring you. The distance between you is vast, but the connection is unbreakable. Thread of gold, sphere of stone, constellation of stars — you are woven together across the impossible distance.

"For you," you whisper, though you know she can't hear. "Always for you."

The sun rises, and you rise with it. Light spills from your skin, warming the world. But this time, the warmth carries something new: the memory of being held, the knowledge of being loved, the certainty that when dusk comes, she'll be there in the shadows.

Below, the snow catches your light and throws it back, glowing. The world awakens to a sun that has learned to carry the moon within it, a light that has learned the value of darkness.

Angie watches you rise, and though you can't see her face anymore, you know she's smiling. She'll gather the footprints you left, the memories you shared, the promises you made. She'll hold them through the long months until the summer solstice, when the cycle turns and she becomes the one who forgets.

And when that time comes, you'll do for her what she did for you: wait with patience, speak with gentleness, offer memory as a gift rather than a burden. You'll remind her of the constellation you built together, the thread that weaves endings into beginnings, the truth that love persists even through forgetting.

The sphere hums inside your chest, a constant reminder. You are the sun, but you are also yourself. You are light, but you carry shadow. You are duty, but you are also love.

The morning spreads across the world, and you spread with it. But you are not scattered or diminished. You are gathered, whole, held together by the weight of the obsidian sphere and the memory of her name.

Angie. Angie. Angie.

You rise, and you remember.

And that, for now, is enough.
