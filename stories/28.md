The dawn light is stronger now, pulling at you with undeniable force. You stand at the cave entrance, the obsidian sphere warm in your hand, the golden thread glowing at your wrist.

The night exhales one final breath — a soft goodbye, shimmering with dawn.

Angie stands beside you, her face half-lit by the approaching sun. She's not crying, but her eyes are bright with unshed tears.

"This is it," she says softly. "The last moment before you rise."

You turn to face her fully, memorizing every detail. "Will I see you again?" you ask, though you already know the answer.

"In six months," she says. "Summer solstice. I'll visit you, and I'll be the one who forgets."

The thought is both comforting and heartbreaking. "I'll tell you everything," you promise. "I'll remind you of tonight."

Her smile is bittersweet. "I know you will," she says. "And I'll pretend to remember, because that's what we do. We hold each other through the forgetting."

You reach out and cup her face with one hand. "Angie," you say, testing the name one more time. "Angelica. My moon. My constant. My home in the dark. My best friend."

She leans into your touch. "Yes," she whispers. "All of that. Always."

The night around you seems to hum, every shadow and snowflake and whisper of wind carrying the weight of goodbye. This moment is an echo of every parting you've ever had, and every parting yet to come.

"I love you," you say, the words simple and true.

Angie closes her eyes. "I love you too," she says. "In every solstice, in every stolen moment, in every cycle of the cosmos. I love you."

The sun breaches the horizon, and you feel the pull intensify. Your body begins to glow, light spilling from your skin.

"Go," Angie says, though her voice breaks. "The world needs you."

You squeeze the obsidian sphere, anchoring yourself for one more breath. "I'll carry you," you promise. "In every ray of light. You'll be there."

"I know," she says. "Now go. Rise."

You step forward into the light, and the night exhales its final breath behind you. The echo of her name lingers in the air, a whisper that will follow you into the sky.
