You hover at the threshold between earth and sky, one last moment before you must fully commit to rising. The obsidian sphere in your hand pulses with all the memories of the night.

You understand now: this night, this meeting, this ritual — it's not an ending. It's a chapter. One of countless chapters in a story that spans millennia, that will continue long after this goodbye.

Angie stands below, small and luminous in the dawn light. "What comes next?" you call to her.

"I don't know," she calls back, and there's freedom in her voice. "The future isn't written yet. That's the gift."

You clutch the sphere tighter. "What if I can't do this again?" you ask. "What if next time I fall and I can't find my way to you?"

Her smile is steady. "Then I'll find you," she says simply. "I always do. The story isn't finished, and we're still writing it together."

A memory blooms: the two of you, long ago, sitting beneath the stars and talking about what came next. Not with fear, but with curiosity. You'd wondered what the world would look like in a thousand years, what new ways you might find to reach each other, what the next chapter might hold.

"We get to choose," you say, the realization settling deep. "Not the circumstances, but how we respond. Not the punishment, but what we build within it."

Angie nods. "Exactly," she says. "The story is ours. They can separate us, but they can't write our ending."

You take a breath, feeling the weight of the future — not as burden, but as possibility. The sun must rise. You must return to duty. But in six months, she'll visit you. And in six months after that, you'll fall again. And the cycle will continue, each meeting adding new pages to a story that refuses to end.

"I'll see you in the summer," you say, voice firm. "Under the long light, when you visit my light."

Her laugh is bright and tearful. "I'll be waiting," she promises. "For new stories and old memories and all the love I've been saving."

The sphere in your hand glows brighter, recording this promise. The future is unwritten, but it's not empty. It's full of potential, of choices, of moments yet to be stolen and cherished.

You rise higher, the book of this night closing gently. But the story hums on, waiting for the next page to turn.
