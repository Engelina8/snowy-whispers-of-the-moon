She lays a card on the snow between you, face up. The paper is worn at the edges. The picture shows a woman kneeling by a pool, pouring light. The figure is simple and stubbornly hopeful.

"This is The Star," she says, voice so soft it could be the crackle of the lantern. "It means hope. It means the strength to keep on when the dark gets heavy." She taps the corner of the card like a benediction.

The compass sleeps, but its needle dreams of auroras and home.

You stare at the woman in the card. The image feels like a tide in a small glass — it moves you, but it does not drown you. For one small instant a sound forms inside your chest: an old, affectionate nickname. "Angie." The word arrives like a gull over open water — inevitable and familiar.

She smiles at you with something like relief folding the edges of her face. "That was it, wasn't it?" she says, and the name in her mouth is warm as an ember. "I've always been Angie to you. Angelica in the long papers and past hurt names. But 'Angie' is mine."

The remembering is a thin yet luminous thing. It does not tell you why you were split apart. It only hands back a thread: her name, and the way it fits in your mouth as if it had lived there all along.

She draws a circle in the snow with her heel and sets three small bundles inside it — herbs, a handful of glittering salt, a strip of cloth you've seen before. "We have to make the offerings right," she says. "The cave will take what it wants if we leave it careless. The ritual must be exact."

You help her pile the bundles, feeling the scrape of dried leaves against your fingers. Each motion is small and specific. Each knot must be tightened. The preparation is like learning an old song again: the beats are precise and insist on themselves.

She glances at your face as if checking that the name sits comfortably there. "You were always stubborn about the small things," she says, laughing softly. "Angie would say the same." Then she grows quieter. "We can't stay long. The sky will thin toward morning."

You fold the cloth and wrap the herbs as she guides you. The name holds. It is a fragile talisman in your mouth. It steadies the step toward the cave and the strange, sharp work you must do when you arrive.
