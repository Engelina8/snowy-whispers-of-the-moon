Angie leads you outside one last time. The snow is pristine, untouched except for the path you've walked together throughout the night.

"Look," she says, gesturing behind you.

You turn and see them: footprints glowing faintly in the snow, each step illuminated as if lit from within.

Snow holds every step — not to trap, but to remember.

The trail stretches back toward the frozen stream, the reindeer's path, the cabin in the distance. Every place you've been together tonight is marked, preserved.

"They'll fade when you leave," Angie says quietly. "But they were real. They mattered."

You walk back along the path, retracing your steps. Each footprint pulses as you pass, a small light answering your presence. You remember each moment: the cold, the bracelet, the hair stick, the frost-letters, the card, the flowers, the umbrella, the stones, the constellation, the scarf.

"This is what you'll take with you," Angie says, following behind. "Not the perfect memory of every word we spoke, but the feeling of having walked a path together. Of having left marks that mattered."

You kneel beside one of the footprints and press your hand into the snow beside it. Your handprint glows too, joining the record.

"I don't want them to fade," you say, voice breaking.

Angie kneels beside you. "They'll fade from the snow," she says gently. "But not from the world. Every step you took tonight changed something. The reindeer will remember. The flowers will remember. The stars will remember."

She takes your glowing hand in hers. "And the Moon will remember," she adds fiercely. "Every footprint, every breath, every moment you were here. I'll hold it for both of us until you fall again."

You look at the path one more time — the physical proof that you existed here, that you walked beside her, that you were real and present and loved.

"Thank you," you whisper.

She squeezes your hand. "Always," she says.

The footprints glow brighter for a heartbeat, as if acknowledging the goodbye. Then they begin to soften, the light dimming as dawn approaches. But the memory remains, etched not in snow but in something deeper.
